# System Preparation

Since all the builds are performed on the Netlify platform you don't really need to run any system setup.

However, for local builds/test you will require to:

**Download and Install HUGO**

The steps for the HUGO installation depend on your system so please follow the instructions available in the [HUGO website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).


# Template customization


- config/ : General website configuration
- content/lang
    - authors : One entry per author
    - home : One entry per section on the main page
    - post : One entry per post
    - project : One entry per project
    - publication : One entry per publication
    - talk : One entry per talk

Multiple languages are supported by adding the content to different lang folders.


# Building

```shell
hugo server --watch
firefox http://localhost:1313
```

# Deploying to Netlify

- Commit all changes
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "New version"
git push origin master
```

- Netlify triggers build on master commits so just check out the updated website
