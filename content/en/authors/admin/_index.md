<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am a Ph.D student with research experience in experimental & computational genomics, next-generation DNA/RNA sequencing, and transposable element analysis. Currently, I am interested in computational biology methods and their applications to understand genomics, genetics, and molecular biology. I am always looking to connect people in related fields to explore research opportunities.</p>
