abstract:<p style='text-align: justify;'>The silkworms, domesticated over the last 5000 years from wild progenitors, are an
important source of livelihood for subsistence farmers engaged in silk production in many
countries. Silk, a natural protein fiber composed mainly of Fibroin (75%) and Sericin (25%),
is getting interest by researchers due to its luster and elegance property. Currently, it is
produced by five major types of silkworms including mulberry, tasar, oak tasar, eri and muga
among which mulberry silkworm (Bombyx mori) is the most popular for commercial silk
production which completely feeds on the leaves of mulberry plant. Seri-Bioresource
database (SBDB) is a flat file based database which provides all the information regarding
silkworms their distribution, diseases, pests, predators and parasites including their host
plantâ€™s distribution, diseases, and pests. This database will be extremely useful for
researchers, industry personals, and even for formers involved in sericulture.</p>
