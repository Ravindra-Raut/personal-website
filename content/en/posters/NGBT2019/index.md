summary: "Analysis of Transposable elements in different Rice species"
abstract: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA elements which exist in almost all eukaryotic genomes as they have regulatory or coding sequences and often occur in large copy numbers. TEs can cause the transcription or methylation of nearby genes and significantly promote structural variation or genome size expansion. However, TEs are rapidly evolving due to the arms races with their host genomes.
In the present work, we investigated the TEs in Oryza sativa L. as it is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population and it is model organism for genomic research; but can be attacked by most devastating pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae causes Rice Blast disease, which significantly reduces yield up to 65% and grain quality. Plant disease resistance (R) genes can detect a pathogen attack and facilitate a counter-attack against the pathogen, but TEs can affect the expression of these R - genes.
We analyzed 29 different rice species by using RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker. The data indicates the average TE content of rice genome assemblies is 38.79%, with low for O. brachyantha (20.47%), high for O. punctate (48.55%) and 66 different TEs are associated with-in different 66 R-genes of O. sativa Nipponbare in 113 copies.</p>"
